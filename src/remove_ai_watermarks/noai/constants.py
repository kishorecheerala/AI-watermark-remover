#     Confirmed by OpenAI's Help Center ("C2PA and SynthID in OpenAI-generated
#     images", updated 2026-05-21): "Images generated with ChatGPT, Codex, and
#     our API include both C2PA metadata and SynthID watermarks." OpenAI also
#     notes a signal may be absent if "the image was created before these
#     signals were available" -- so OpenAI images from BEFORE the rollout carry
#     C2PA WITHOUT SynthID (e.g. data/samples/openai-images-2/amur-leopard.png,

#     is openai.com/verify (Google's is the Gemini app "Verify with SynthID").
# The issuer byte ("OpenAI"/"Google") is verified locally against data/samples;
# the SynthID pairing is documented behavior (Google: DeepMind; OpenAI: above).
# Adobe Firefly and Microsoft Designer sign C2PA but do NOT use SynthID, so a
# C2PA manifest alone is not a SynthID signal -- the issuer is. The pixel
# watermark is not locally detectable (proprietary decoder); the C2PA companion
# is the proxy, and only while the manifest is intact.
